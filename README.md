# DynamicScene
A dynamic scene in BABYLON.js

Basic idea is to set a basic scene in which things can happen.
- the camera is static
- code for scene events are dynamycally loaded on a random basis
- for instance we have a pool of 50 possible events
  and the max amount happening at the same time is 9

- needs to be arti-farty
- needs to be eye-candy
